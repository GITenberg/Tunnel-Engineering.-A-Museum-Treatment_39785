TUNNEL ENGINEERING&mdash;A MUSEUM TREATMENT</p>

<blockquote><p><i>During the years from 1830 to 1900, extensive developments took
place in the field of tunneling, which today is an important,
firmly established branch of civil engineering. This paper offers
a picture of its growth from the historical standpoint, based on
a series of models constructed for the Hall of Civil Engineering
in the new Museum of History and Technology. The eight
models described highlight the fundamental advances which have
occurred between primitive man&rsquo;s first systematic use of fire for
excavating rock in mining, and the use in combination of compressed
air, an iron lining, and a movable shield in a subaqueous
tunnel at the end of the 19th century.</i></p>

<p class="caption2"><a name="Introduction"
id="Introduction"></a>Introduction</p>

<div class="dropcap">W</div>
<p class="p0">ith few exceptions, civil engineering is a field
in which the ultimate goal is the assemblage of
materials into a useful structural form according to a
scientifically derived plan which is based on various
natural and man-imposed conditions. This is true
whether the result be, for example, a dam, a building,
a bridge, or even the fixed plant of a railroad. However,
one principal branch of the field is based upon
an entirely different concept. In the engineering of
tunnels the utility of the &ldquo;structure&rdquo; is derived not
from the bringing together of elements but from the
separation of one portion of naturally existing material
from another to permit passage through a former
barrier.</p>

<p>In tunneling hard, firm rock, this is practically
the entire compass of the work: breaking away the
rock from the mother mass, and, coincidently, removing
it from the workings. The opposite extreme
in conditions is met in the soft-ground tunnel, driven
through material incapable of supporting itself above
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
the tunnel opening. Here, the excavation of the
tunneled substance is of relatively small concern,
eclipsed by the problem of preventing the surrounding
material from collapsing into the bore.</p>

model&mdash;&frac12;" scale. (Smithsonian photo 49260-L.)</p>
</div>

<p>In one other principal respect does tunnel engineering
differ widely from its collateral branches of
civil engineering. Few other physical undertakings
are approached with anything like the uncertainty
attending a tunnel work. This is even more true in
mountain tunnels, for which test borings frequently
cannot be made to determine the nature of the
material and the geologic conditions which will be
encountered.</p>

<p>The course of tunnel work is not subject to an overall
preliminary survey; the engineer is faced with not
only the inability to anticipate general contingencies
common to all engineering work, but with the peculiar
and often overwhelming unpredictability of the
very basis of his work.</p>

<p>Subaqueous and soft-ground work on the other
hand, while still subject to many indeterminates, is
now far more predictable than during its early history,
simply because the nature of the adverse condition
prevailing eventually was understood to be quite
predictable. The steady pressures of earth and water
to refill the excavated area are today overcome with
relative ease and consistency by the tunneler.</p>

<p>In tunneling as in no other branch of civil engineering
did empiricism so long resist the advance of scientific
theory; in no other did the &ldquo;practical engineer&rdquo;
remain to such an extent the key figure in establishing
the success or failure of a project. The Hoosac Tunnel,
after 25 years of legislative, financial, and technical
difficulties, in 1875 was finally driven to successful
completion only by the efforts of a group who, while
in the majority were trained civil engineers, were to
an even greater extent men of vast practical ability,
more at home in field than office.</p>

<p>DeWitt C. Haskin (see <a href="#Haskin">p. 234</a>), during the inquest
that followed the death of a number of men in a
blowout of his pneumatically driven Hudson River
Tunnel in 1880, stated in his own defense: &ldquo;I am not
a scientific engineer, but a practical one ... I know
nothing of mathematics; in my experience I have
grasped such matters as a whole; I believe that the
study of mathematics in that kind of work [tunneling]
has a tendency to dwarf the mind rather than enlighten
it....&rdquo; An extreme attitude perhaps, and
one which by no means adds to Haskin&rsquo;s stature, but
a not unusual one in tunnel work at the time. It
would not of course be fair to imply that such men
as Herman Haupt, Brunel the elder, and Greathead
were not accomplished theoretical engineers. But it
was their innate ability to evaluate and control the
overlying physical conditions of the site and work that
made possible their significant contributions to the
development of tunnel engineering.</p>

<p>Tunneling remained largely independent of the
realm of mathematical analysis long after the time
when all but the most insignificant engineering works
were designed by that means. Thus, as structural
engineering has advanced as the result of a flow of
new theoretical concepts, new, improved, and strengthened
materials, and new methods of fastening, the
progress of tunnel engineering has been due more to
the continual refinement of constructional techniques.</p>

<p class="caption3">A NEW HALL OF CIVIL ENGINEERING</p>

<p>In the Museum of History and Technology has
recently been established a Hall of Civil Engineering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
in which the engineering of tunnels is comprehensively
treated from the historical standpoint&mdash;something
not previously done in an American museum.
The guiding precept of the exhibit has not been to
outline exhaustively the entire history of tunneling,
but rather to show the fundamental advances which
have occurred between primitive man&rsquo;s first systematic
use of fire for excavating rock in mining, and the use
in combination of compressed air, iron lining, and a
movable shield in a subaqueous tunnel at the end of
the 19th century. This termination date was selected
because it was during the period from about 1830 to
1900 that the most concentrated development took
place, and during which tunneling became a firmly
established and important branch of civil engineering
and indeed, of modern civilization. The techniques
of present-day tunneling are so fully related in current
writing that it was deemed far more useful to
devote the exhibit entirely to a segment of the field&rsquo;s
history which is less commonly treated.</p>

</div>

<p>The major advances, which have already been
spoken of as being ones of technique rather than
theory, devolve quite naturally into two basic classifications:
the one of supporting a mass of loose,
unstable, pressure-exerting material&mdash;soft-ground tunneling;
and the diametrically opposite problem of
separating rock from the basic mass when it is so
firm and solid that it can support its own overbearing
weight as an opening is forced through it&mdash;rock, or
hard-ground tunneling.</p>

<p>To exhibit the sequence in a thorough manner,
inviting and capable of easy and correct interpretation
by the nonprofessional viewer, models offered
the only logical means of presentation. Six tunnels
were selected, all driven in the 19th century. Each
represents either a fundamental, new concept of
tunneling technique, or an important, early application
of one. Models of these works form the basis of
the exhibit. No effort was made to restrict the work
to projects on American soil. This would, in fact, have
been quite impossible if an accurate picture of tunnel
technology was to be drawn; for as in virtually all
other areas of technology, the overall development in
this field has been international. The art of mining
was first developed highly in the Middle Ages in the
Germanic states; the tunnel shield was invented by
a Frenchman residing in England, and the use of
compressed air to exclude the water from subaqueous
tunnels was first introduced on a major work by an
American. In addition, the two main subdivisions,
rock and soft-ground tunneling, are each introduced
by a model not of an actual working, but of one
typifying early classical methods which were in use
for centuries until the comparatively recent development
of more efficient systems of earth support and
rock breaking. Particular attention is given to accuracy
of detail throughout the series of eight models;
original sources of descriptive and graphic information
were used in their construction wherever possible. In
all cases except the introductory model in the rock-tunneling
series, representing copper mining by early
civilizations, these sources were contemporary
accounts.</p>

<p>The plan to use a uniform scale of reduction
throughout, in order to facilitate the viewers&rsquo; interpretation,
unfortunately proved impractical, due to
the great difference in the amount of area to be
encompassed in different models, and the necessity
that the cases holding them be of uniform height. The
related models of the Broadway and Tower Subways
represent short sections of tunnels only 8 feet or so in
diameter enabling a relatively large scale, 1&frac12; inches
to the foot, to be used. Conversely, in order that the
model of Brunel&rsquo;s Thames Tunnel be most effective,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
it was necessary to include one of the vertical terminal
shafts used in its construction. These were about 60
feet in depth, and thus the much smaller scale of
&frac14; inch to the foot was used. This variation is not
as confusing as might be thought, for the human
figures in each model provide an immediate and
positive sense of proportion and scale.</p>

<p>Careful thought was devoted to the internal lighting
of the models, as this was one of the critical factors in
establishing, so far as is possible in a model, an
atmosphere convincingly representative of work
conducted solely by artificial light. Remarkable
realism was achieved by use of plastic rods to conduct
light to the tiny sources of tunnel illumination, such
as the candles on the miners&rsquo; hats in the Hoosac
Tunnel, and the gas lights in the Thames Tunnel.
No overscaled miniature bulbs, generally applied in
such cases, were used. At several points where the
general lighting within the tunnel proper has been
kept at a low level to simulate the natural atmosphere
of the work, hidden lamps can be operated by push-button
in order to bring out detail which otherwise
would be unseen.</p>

<p>The remainder of the material in the Museum&rsquo;s
tunneling section further extends the two major aspects
of tunneling. Space limitations did not permit
treatment of the many interesting ancillary matters
vital to tunnel engineering, such as the unique problems
of subterranean surveying, and the extreme
accuracy required in the triangulation and subsequent
guidance of the boring in long mountain tunnels;
nor the difficult problems of ventilating long workings,
both during driving and in service; nor the several
major methods developed through the years for
driving or constructing tunnels in other than the
conventional manner.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>


<p class="caption2"><a name="Rock_Tunneling"
id="Rock_Tunneling"></a>Rock Tunneling</p>

<p>While the art of tunneling soft ground is of relatively
recent origin, that of rock tunneling is deeply
rooted in antiquity. However, the line of its development
is not absolutely direct, but is more
logically followed through a closely related branch
of technology&mdash;mining. The development of mining
techniques is a practically unbroken one, whereas
there appears little continuity or relationship between
the few works undertaken before about the 18th
century for passage through the earth.</p>

<p>The Egyptians were the first people in recorded
history to have driven openings, often of considerable
magnitude, through solid rock. As is true of all
major works of that nation, the capability of such
grand proportion was due solely to the inexhaustible
supply of human power and the casual evaluation of
life. The tombs and temples won from the rock
masses of the Nile Valley are monuments of perseverance
rather than technical skill. Neither the
Egyptians nor any other peoples before the Middle
Ages have left any consistent evidence that they were
able to pierce ground that would not support itself
above the opening as would firm rock. In Egypt
were established the methods of rock breaking that
were to remain classical until the first use of gun-powder
blasting in the 17th century which formed the
basis of the ensuing technology of mining.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the religious motives which inspired
the earliest rock excavations, more constant and
universal throughout history has been the incentive
to obtain the useful and decorative minerals hidden
beneath the earth&rsquo;s surface. It was the miner who
developed the methods introduced by the early civilizations
to break rock away from the primary mass,
and who added the refinements of subterranean surveying
and ventilating, all of which were later to be
assimilated into the new art of driving tunnels of large
diameter. The connection is the more evident from
the fact that tunnelmen are still known as miners.</p>


<p class="caption3">COPPER MINING, B.C.</p>

<p>Therefore, the first model of the sequence, reflecting
elemental rock-breaking techniques, depicts a hard-rock
copper mine (<a href="#Fig_41_1">fig. 1</a>). Due to the absence of
specific information about such works during the
pre-Christian eras, this model is based on no particular
period or locale, but represents in a general way,
a mine in the Rio Tinto area of Spain where copper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
has been extracted since at least 1000 B.C. Similar
workings existed in the Tirol as early as about 1600
B.C. Two means of breaking away the rock are
shown: to the left is the most primitive of all methods,
the hammer and chisel, which require no further
description. At the right side, the two figures are
shown utilizing the first rock-breaking method in
which a force beyond that of human muscles was
employed, the age-old &ldquo;fire-setting&rdquo; method. The
rock was thoroughly heated by a fierce fire built
against its face and then suddenly cooled by dashing
water against it. The thermal shock disintegrated the
rock or ore into bits easily removable by hand.</p>

<p>The practice of this method below ground, of
course, produced a fearfully vitiated atmosphere. It
is difficult to imagine whether the smoke, the steam,
or the toxic fumes from the roasting ore was the more
distressing to the miners. Even when performed by
labor considered more or less expendable, the method
could be employed only where there was ventilation
of some sort: natural chimneys and convection currents
were the chief sources of air circulation. Despite
the drawbacks of the fire system, its simplicity and
efficacy weighed so heavily in its favor that its history
of use is unbroken almost to the present day. Fire
setting was of greatest importance during the years of
intensive mining in Europe before the advent of
explosive blasting, but its use in many remote areas
hardly slackened until the early 20th century because
of its low cost when compared to powder. For this
same reason, it did have limited application in actual
tunnel work until about 1900.</p>

<p>Direct handwork with pick, chisel and hammer, and
fire setting were the principal means of rock removal
for centuries. Although various wedging systems
were also in favor in some situations, their importance
was so slight that they were not shown in the
model.</p>

<p class="caption3">HOOSAC TUNNEL</p>

<p>It was possible in the model series, without neglecting
any major advancement in the art of rock
tunneling, to complete the sequence of development
with only a single additional model. Many of the
greatest works of civil engineering have been those
concerned directly with transport, and hence are the
product of the present era, beginning in the early
19th century. The development of the ancient arts of
route location, bridge construction, and tunnel
driving received a powerful stimulation after 1800
under the impetus of the modern canal, highway, and,
especially, the railroad.</p>

<p>The Hoosac Tunnel, driven through Hoosac
Mountain in the very northwest corner of Massachusetts
between 1851 and 1875, was the first major
tunneling work in the United States. Its importance
is due not so much to this as to its being literally
the fountainhead of modern rock-tunneling technology.
The remarkable thing is that the work was
begun using methods of driving almost unchanged
during centuries previous, and was completed twenty
years later by techniques which were, for the day,
almost totally mechanized. The basic pattern of
operation set at Hoosac, using pneumatic rock drills
and efficient explosives, remains practically unchanged
today.</p>

<p>The general history of the Hoosac project is so
thoroughly recorded that the briefest outline of its
political aspects will suffice here. Hoosac Mountain
was the chief obstacle in the path of a railroad projected
between Greenfield, Massachusetts, and Troy,
New York. The line was launched by a group of
Boston merchants to provide a direct route to the
rapidly developing West, in competition with the
coastal routes via New York. The only route
economically reasonable included a tunnel of nearly
five miles through the mountain&mdash;a length absolutely
without precedent, and an immense undertaking in
view of the relatively primitive rock-working methods
then available.</p>

<p>The bore&rsquo;s great length and the desire for rapid
exploitation inspired innovation from the outset of
the work. The earliest attempts at mechanization,
although ineffectual and without influence on tunnel
engineering until many years later, are of interest.
These took the form of several experimental machines
of the &ldquo;full area&rdquo; type, intended to excavate the entire
face of the work in a single operation by cutting one
or more concentric grooves in the rock. The rock
remaining between the grooves was to be blasted out.
The first such machine tested succeeded in boring a
24-foot diameter opening for 10 feet before its total
failure. Several later machines proved of equal
merit.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
It was the Baltimore and Ohio&rsquo;s eminent
chief engineer, Benjamin H. Latrobe, who in his
<i>Report on the Hoosac Tunnel</i> (Baltimore, Oct. 1, 1862,
p. 125) stated that such apparatus contained in its
own structure the elements of failure, &ldquo; ... as they
require the machines to do too much and the powder
too little of the work, thus contradicting the fundamental
principles upon which all labor-saving
machinery is framed ... I could only look upon it
as a misapplication of mechanical genius.&rdquo;</p>

</div>

<p>Latrobe stated the basic philosophy of rock-tunnel
work. No mechanical agent has ever been able to
improve upon the efficiency of explosives for the shattering
of rock. For this reason, the logical application
of machinery to tunneling was not in replacing or
altering the fundamental process itself, but in enabling
it to be conducted with greater speed by mechanically
drilling the blasting holes to receive the explosive.</p>

<p>Actual work on the Hoosac Tunnel began at both
ends of the tunnel in about 1854, but without much
useful effect until 1858 when a contract was let to
the renowned civil engineer and railroad builder,
Herman Haupt of Philadelphia. Haupt immediately
resumed investigations of improved tunneling methods,
both full-area machines and mechanical rock
drills. At this time mechanical rock-drill technology
was in a state beyond, but not far beyond, initial
experimentation. There existed one workable American
machine, the Fowle drill, invented in 1851. It
was steam-driven, and had been used in quarry work,
although apparently not to any commercial extent.
However, it was far too large and cumbersome to
find any possible application in tunneling. Nevertheless,
it contained in its operating principle, the
seed of a practical rock drill in that the drill rod was
attached directly to and reciprocated by a double-acting
steam piston. A point of great importance
was the independence of its operation on gravity,
permitting drilling in any direction.</p>

<p>While experimenting, Haupt drove the work onward
by the classical methods, shown in the left-hand
section of the model (<a href="#Fig_41_2">fig. 2</a>). At the far right an
advance heading or adit is being formed by pick and
hammer work; this is then deepened into a top
heading with enough height to permit hammer
drilling, actually the basic tunneling operation. A
team is shown &ldquo;double jacking,&rdquo; i.e., using two-handed
hammers, the steel held by a third man.
This was the most efficient of the several hand-drilling
methods. The top-heading plan was followed so
that the bulk of the rock could be removed in the
form of a bottom bench, and the majority of drilling
would be downward, obviously the most effective
direction. Blasting was with black powder and its
commercial variants. Some liberty was taken in depicting
these steps so that both operations might be
shown within the scope of the model: in practice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the heading was kept between 400 and 600 feet in
advance of the bench so that heading blasts would
not interfere with the bench work. The bench
carriage simply facilitated handling of the blasted
rock. It was rolled back during blasts.</p>

</div>

<p>The experiments conducted by Haupt with machine
drills produced no immediate useful results. A drill
designed by Haupt and his associate, Stuart Gwynn,
in 1858 bored hard granite at the rate of <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch per
minute, but was not substantial enough to bear up
in service. Haupt left the work in 1861, victim of
intense political pressures and totally unjust accusations
of corruption and mismanagement. The work
was suspended until taken over by a state commission
in 1862. Despite frightful ineptitude and very real
corruption, this period was exceedingly important
in the long history both of Hoosac Tunnel and of rock
tunneling in general.</p>

<p>The merely routine criticism of the project had by
this time become violent due to the inordinate length
of time already elapsed and the immense cost, compared
to the small portion of work completed. This
served to generate in the commission a strong sense
of urgency to hurry the project along. Charles S.
Storrow, a competent engineer, was sent to Europe
to report on the progress of tunneling there, and in
particular on mechanization at the Mont Cenis Tunnel
then under construction between France and Italy.
Germain Sommeiller, its chief engineer, had, after
experimentation similar to Haupt&rsquo;s, invented a
reasonably efficient drilling machine which had gone
into service at Mont Cenis in March 1861. It was
a distinct improvement over hand drilling, almost
doubling the drilling rate, but was complex and highly
unreliable. Two hundred drills were required to keep
16 drills at work. But the vital point in this was the
fact that Sommeiller drove his drills not with steam,
but air, compressed at the tunnel portals and piped
to the work face. It was this single factor, one of
application rather than invention, that made the
mechanical drill feasible for tunneling.</p>

<p>All previous effort in the field of machine drilling, on
both sides of the Atlantic, had been directed toward
steam as the motive power. In deep tunnels, with
ventilation already an inherent problem, the exhaust
of a steam drill into the atmosphere was inadmissible.
Further, steam could not be piped over great distances
due to serious losses of energy from radiation of heat,
and condensation. Steam generation within the
tunnel itself was obviously out of the question. It
was the combination of a practical drill, and the
parallel invention by Sommeiller of a practical air
compressor that resulted in the first workable application
of machine rock drilling to tunneling.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>
<p>The Sommeiller drills greatly impressed Storrow,
and his report of November 1862 strongly favored
their adoption at Hoosac. It is curious however, that
not a single one was brought to the U.S., even on
trial. Storrow does speak of Sommeiller&rsquo;s intent to
keep the details of the machine to himself until it had
been further improved, with a view to its eventual
exploitation. The fact is, that although workable, the
Sommeiller drill proved to be a dead end in rock-drill
development because of its many basic deficiencies.
It did exert the indirect influence of inspiration which,
coupled with a pressing need for haste, led to renewed
trials of drilling machinery at Hoosac. Thomas
Doane, chief engineer under the state commission,
carried this program forth with intensity, seeking and
encouraging inventors, and himself working on the
problem. The pattern of the Sommeiller drill was
generally followed; that is, the drill was designed as
a separate, relatively light mechanical element,
adapted for transportation by several miners, and
attachable to a movable frame or carriage during
operation. Air was of course the presumed power.
To be effective, it was necessary that a drill automatically
feed the drill rod as the hole deepened, and
also rotate the rod automatically to maintain a round,
smooth hole. Extreme durability was essential, and
usually proved the source of a machine&rsquo;s failure.
The combination of these characteristics into a
machine capable of driving the drill rod into the rock
with great force, perhaps five times per second, was a
severe test of ingenuity and materials. Doane in 1864
had three different experimental drills in hand, as
well as various steam and water-powered compressors.</p>

<p>Success finally came in 1865 with the invention of
a drill by Charles Burleigh, a mechanical engineer
at the well-known Putnam Machine Works of Fitchburg,
Massachusetts. The drills were first applied
in the east heading in June of 1866. Although
working well, their initial success was limited by
lack of reliability and a resulting high expense for
repairs. They were described as having &ldquo;several
weakest points.&rdquo; In November, these drills were
replaced by an improved Burleigh drill which was
used with total success to the end of the work. The
era of modern rock tunneling was thus launched by
Sommeiller&rsquo;s insight in initially applying pneumatic
power to a machine drill, by Doane&rsquo;s persistence in
searching for a thoroughly practical drill, and by
Burleigh&rsquo;s mechanical talent in producing one. The
desperate need to complete the Hoosac Tunnel may
reasonably be considered the greatest single spur to
the development of a successful drill.</p>

<p>The significance of this invention was far reaching.
Burleigh&rsquo;s was the first practical mechanical rock
drill in America and, in view of its dependability,
efficiency, and simplicity when compared to the
Sommeiller drill, perhaps in the world. The Burleigh
drill achieved success almost immediately. It was
placed in production by Putnam for the Burleigh
Rock Drill Company before completion of Hoosac in
1876, and its use spread throughout the western
mining regions and other tunnel works. For a major
invention, its adoption was, in relative terms, instantaneous.
It was the prototype of all succeeding
piston-type drills, which came to be known generically
as &ldquo;burleighs,&rdquo; regardless of manufacture. Walter
Shanley, the Canadian contractor who ultimately
completed the Hoosac, reported in 1870, after the
drills had been in service for a sufficient time that
the techniques for their most efficient use were fully
understood and effectively applied, that the Burleigh
drills saved about half the drilling costs over hand
drilling. The per-inch cost of machine drilling
averaged 5.5 cents, all inclusive, vs. 11.2 cents for
handwork. The more important point, that of
speed, is shown by the reports of average monthly
progress of the tunnel itself, before and after use of
the air drills.</p>

<p>The right portion of the model (<a href="#Fig_41_3">fig. 3</a>) represents
the workings during the final period. The bottom
heading system was generally used after the Burleigh
drills had been introduced. Four to six drills were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
mounted on a carriage designed by Doane. These
drove the holes for the first blast in the center of the
heading in about six hours. The full width of the
heading, the 24-foot width of the tunnel, was then
drilled and blasted out in two more stages. As in
the early section, the benches to the rear were later
removed to the full-tunnel height of about 20 feet.
This operation is shown by a single drill (<a href="#Fig_41_4">fig. 4</a>)
mounted on a screw column. Three 8-hour shifts carried
the work forward: drilling occupied half the
time and half was spent in running the carriage back,
blasting, and mucking (clearing the broken rock).</p>

<p>The tunnel&rsquo;s 1028-foot central shaft, completed
under the Shanley contract in 1870 to provide two
additional work faces as well as a ventilation shaft is
shown at the far right side of this half of the model.
Completed so near the end of the project, only 15
percent of the tunnel was driven from the shaft.</p>

<p>The enormous increase in rate of progress was not
due entirely to machine drilling. From the outset
of his jurisdiction, Doane undertook experiments with
explosives as well as drills, seeking an agent more
effective than black powder. In this case, the need
for speed was not the sole stimulus. As the east and
west headings advanced further and further from the
portals, the problem of ventilation grew more acute,
and it became increasingly difficult to exhaust the
toxic fumes produced by the black powder blasts.</p>

<p>In 1866, Doane imported from Europe a sample
of trinitroglycerine, the liquid explosive newly introduced
by Nobel, known in Europe as &ldquo;glonoïn oil&rdquo;
and in the United States as &ldquo;nitroglycerine.&rdquo; It
already had acquired a fearsome reputation from its
tendency to decompose with heat and age and to
explode with or without the slightest provocation.
Nevertheless, its tremendous power and characteristic
of almost complete smokelessness led Doane to
employ the chemist George W. Mowbray, who had
blasted for Drake in the Pennsylvania oil fields, to
develop techniques for the bulk manufacture of the
new agent and for its safe employment in the tunnel.</p>

</div>

<p>Mowbray established a works on the mountain and
shortly developed a completely new blasting practice
based on the explosive. Its stability was greatly increased
by maintaining absolute purity in the manufacturing
process. Freezing the liquid to reduce its
sensitivity during transport to the headings, and
extreme caution in its handling further reduced the
hazard of its use. At the heading, the liquid was
poured into cylindrical cartridges for placement in
the holes. As with the Burleigh drill, the general
adoption of nitroglycerine was immediate once its
qualities had been demonstrated. The effect on the
work was notable. Its explosive characteristics permitted
fewer blast holes over a given frontal area of
working face, and at the same time it was capable
of effectively blowing from a deeper drill hole, 42
inches against 30 inches for black powder, so that
under ideal conditions 40 percent more tunnel length
was advanced per cycle of operations. A new fuse
and a system of electric ignition were developed which
permitted simultaneous detonation and resulted in
a degree of effectiveness impossible with the powder
train and cord fusing used with the black powder.
Over a million pounds of nitroglycerine were produced
by Mowbray between 1866 and completion of
the tunnel.</p>

<p>When the Shanleys took the work over in 1868,
following political difficulties attending operation by
the State, the period of experimentation was over.
The tunnel was being advanced by totally modern
methods, and to the present day the overall concepts
have remained fundamentally unaltered: the Burleigh
piston drill has been replaced by the lighter
hammer drill; the Doane drill carriage by the more
flexible &ldquo;jumbo&rdquo;;nitroglycerine by its more stable
descendant dynamite and its alternatives; and static-electric
blasting machines by more dependable
magnetoelectric. But these are all in the nature of
improvements, not innovations.</p>

<p>Unlike the preceding model, there was good documentation
for this one. Also, the Hoosac was apparently
the first American tunnel to be well recorded
photographically. Early flashlight views exist of the
drills working at the heading (<a href="#Fig_41_6">fig. 6</a>) as well as of the
portals, the winding and pumping works at the central
shaft, and much of the machinery and associated
aspects of the project. These and copies of drawings
of much of Doane&rsquo;s experimental apparatus, a rare
technological record, are preserved at the Massachusetts
State Library.</p>


<p class="caption2"><a name="Soft-Ground_Tunneling" id="Soft-Ground_Tunneling"></a>
Soft-Ground Tunneling</p>

<p>So great is the difference between hard-rock and
soft-ground tunneling that they constitute two almost
separate branches of the field. In penetrating ground
lacking the firmness or cohesion to support itself above
an opening, the miner&rsquo;s chief concern is not that of
removing the material, but of preventing its collapse
into his excavation. The primitive methods depending
upon brute strength and direct application of fire
and human force were suitable for assault on rock,
but lacked the artifice needed for delving into less
stable material. Roman engineers were accomplished
in spanning subterranean ways with masonry arches,
but apparently most of their work was done by cut-and-cover
methods rather than by actual mining.</p>

<p>Not until the Middle Ages did the skill of effectively
working openings in soft ground develop, and not
until the Renaissance was this development so consistently
successful that it could be considered a
science.</p>

<p class="caption3">RENAISSANCE MINING</p>

<p>From the earliest periods of rock working, the quest
for minerals and metals was the primary force that
drove men underground. It was the technology of
mining, the product of slow evolution over the
centuries, that became the technology of the early
tunnel, with no significant modification except in
size of workings.</p>

<p>Every aspect of 16th century mining is definitively
detailed in Georgius Agricola&rsquo;s remarkable <i>De re
Metallica</i>, first published in Basel in 1556. During
its time of active influence, which extended for two
centuries, it served as the authoritative work on the
subject. It remains today an unparalleled early record
of an entire branch of technology. The superb
woodcuts of mine workings and tools in themselves
constitute a precise description of the techniques of
the period, and provided an ideal source of information
upon which to base the first model in the soft-ground
series.</p>

In areas of only moderate instability, the sets alone
were sufficient to counteract the earth pressure, and
were spaced according to the degree of support
required. In more extreme conditions, a solid lagging
of small poles or boards was set outside the
frames, as shown in the model, to provide absolute
support of the ground. Details of the framing, the
windlass, and all tools and appliances were supplied
by Agricola, with no need for interpretation or
interpolation.</p>

<p>The basic framing pattern of sill, side posts and cap
piece, all morticed together, with lagging used where
needed, was translated unaltered into tunneling practice,
particularly in small exploratory drifts. It
remained in this application until well into the 20th
century.</p>

<p>The pressure exerted upon tunnels of large area
was countered during construction by timbering
systems of greater elaboration, evolved from the basic
one. By the time that tunnels of section large
enough to accommodate canals and railways were
being undertaken as matter-of-course civil engineering
works, a series of nationally distinguishable
systems had emerged, each possessing characteristic
points of favor and fault. As might be suspected, the
English system of tunnel timbering, for instance, was
rarely applied on the Continent, nor were the German,
Austrian or Belgian systems normally seen in Great
Britain. All were used at one time or another in
this country, until the American system was introduced
in about 1855. While the timbering commonly
remained in place in mines, it would be followed up
by permanent masonry arching and lining in tunnel
work.</p>

are frames representing the English, Austrian and
American systems. Nearby, a series of small relief
models (<a href="#Fig_41_19">fig. 19</a>) is used to show the sequence of enlargement
in a soft-ground railroad tunnel of about
1855, using the Austrian system. Temporary timber
support of tunnels fell from use gradually after the
advent of shield tunneling in conjunction with cast-iron
lining. This formed a perfect support immediately
behind the shield, as well as the permanent
lining of the tunnel.</p>

<p class="caption3">BRUNEL&rsquo;S THAMES TUNNEL</p>

<p>The interior surfaces of tunnels through ground
merely unstable are amenable to support by various
systems of timbering and arching. This becomes less
true as the fluidity of the ground increases. The
soft material which normally comprises the beds of
rivers can approach an almost liquid condition
resulting in a hydraulic head from the overbearing
water sufficient to prevent the driving of even the
most carefully worked drift, supported by simple
timbering. The basic defect of the timbering systems
used in mining and tunneling was that there was
inevitably a certain amount of the face or ceiling
unsupported just previous to setting a frame, or
placing over it the necessary section of lagging. In
mine work, runny soil could, and did, break through
such gaps, filling the working. For this reason,
there were no serious attempts made before 1825 to
drive subaqueous tunnels.</p>

<p>In that year, work was started on a tunnel under the
Thames between the Rotherhithe and Wapping
sections of London, under guidance of the already
famous engineer Marc Isambard Brunel (1769-1849),
father of I. K. Brunel. The undertaking is of great
interest in that Brunel employed an entirely novel
apparatus of his own invention to provide continuous
and reliable support of the soft water-bearing clay
which formed the riverbed. By means of this
&ldquo;shield,&rdquo; Brunel was able to drive the world&rsquo;s first
subaqueous tunnel.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The shield was of cast-iron, rectangular in elevation,
and was propelled forward by jackscrews. Shelves at
top, bottom, and sides supported the tunnel roof,
floor, and walls until the permanent brick lining was
placed. The working face, the critical area, was
supported by a large number of small &ldquo;breasting
boards,&rdquo; held against the ground by small individual
screws bearing against the shield framework. The
shield itself was formed of 12 separate frames, each
of which could be advanced independently of the
others. The height was 22 feet 3 inches: the width
37 feet 6 inches.</p>

<p>The progress was piecemeal. In operation the
miners would remove one breasting board at a time,
excavate in front of it, and then replace it in the
advanced position&mdash;about 6 inches forward. This
was repeated with the next board above or below, and
the sequence continued until the ground for the
entire height of one of the 12 sections had been
removed. The board screws for that section were
shifted to bear on the adjacent frames, relieving the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
frame of longitudinal pressure. It could then be
screwed forward by the amount of advance, the
screws bearing to the rear on the completed masonry.
Thus, step by step the tunnel progressed slowly, the
greatest weekly advance being 14 feet.</p>

<p>In the left-hand portion of the model is the shaft

hoist for removing the spoil. The V-type steam engine
powering the hoist was designed by Brunel. At the
right of the main model is an enlarged detail of the
shield, actually an improved version built in 1835.</p>

<p>The work continued despite setbacks of every sort.
The financial ones need no recounting here. Technically,
although the shield principle proved workable,
the support afforded was not infallible. Four or five
times the river broke through the thin cover of silt
and flooded the workings, despite the utmost caution
in excavating. When this occurred, masses of clay,
sandbags, and mats were dumped over the opening
in the riverbed to seal it, and the tunnel pumped out.
I. K. Brunel acted as superintendent and nearly lost
his life on a number of occasions. After several suspensions
of work resulting from withdrawal or
exhaustion of support, one lasting seven years, the
work was completed in 1843.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that Brunel had, for the first time,
demonstrated a practical method for tunneling in firm
and water-bearing ground, the enormous cost of the
work and the almost overwhelming problems encountered
had a discouraging effect rather than otherwise.
Not for another quarter of a century was a similar
project undertaken.</p>

<p>The Thames Tunnel was used for foot and light
highway traffic until about 1870 when it was incorporated
into the London Underground railway
system, which it continues to serve today. The
roofed-over top sections of the two shafts may still be
seen from the river.</p>

<p>A number of contemporary popular accounts of the
tunnel exist, but one of the most thorough and
interesting expositions on a single tunnel work of any
period is Henry Law&rsquo;s <i>A Memoir of the Thames Tunnel</i>,
published in 1845-1846 by John Weale. Law, an
eminent civil engineer, covers the work in incredible
detail from its inception until the major suspension
in late 1828 when slightly more than half completed.
The most valuable aspect of his record is a series of
plates of engineering drawings of the shield and its
components, which, so far as is known, exist nowhere
else. These formed the basis of the enlarged section
of the shield, shown to the right of the model of the
tunnel itself. A vertical section through the shield
is reproduced here from Law for comparison with
the model (figs. 21 and 23).</p>

<p>Various inventors attempted to improve upon the
Brunel shield, aware of the fundamental soundness
of the shield principle. Almost all bypassed the
rectangular sectional construction used in the Thames
Tunnel, and took as a starting point a sectional
shield of circular cross section, advanced by Brunel
in his original patent of 1818. James Henry Greathead
(1844-1896), rightfully called the father of modern
subaqueous tunneling, surmised in later years that
Brunel had chosen a rectangular configuration for
actual use, as one better adapted to the sectional
type of shield. The English civil engineer, Peter W.
Barlow, in 1864 and 1868 patented a circular shield,
of one piece, which was the basis of one used by him in
constructing a small subway of 1350 feet beneath the
Thames in 1869, the first work to follow the lead of
Brunel. Greathead, acting as Barlow&rsquo;s contractor,
was the designer of the shield actually used in the
work, but it was obviously inspired by Barlow&rsquo;s
patents.</p>

<p>The reduction of the multiplicity of parts in the
Brunel shield to a single rigid unit was of immense
advantage and an advance perhaps equal to the
shield concept of tunneling itself. The Barlow-Greathead
shield was like the cap of a telescope with
a sharpened circular ring on the front to assist in
penetrating the ground. The diaphragm functioned,
as did Brunel&rsquo;s breasting boards, to resist the longitudinal
earth pressure of the face, and the cylindrical
portion behind the diaphragm bore the radial pressure
of roof and walls. Here also for the first time, a
permanent lining formed of cast-iron segments was
used, a second major advancement in soft-ground
tunneling practice. Not only could the segments be
placed and bolted together far more rapidly than
masonry lining could be laid up, but unlike the
green masonry, they could immediately bear the full
force of the shield-propelling screws.</p>

<p>Barlow, capitalizing on Brunel&rsquo;s error in burrowing
so close to the riverbed, maintained an average cover
of 30 feet over the tunnel, driving through a solid
stratum of firm London clay which was virtually
impervious to water. As the result of this, combined
with the advantages of the solid shield and the
rapidly placed iron lining, the work moved forward
at a pace and with a facility in startling contrast to
that of the Thames Tunnel, although in fairness it
must be recalled that the face area was far less.</p>

<p>The clay was found sufficiently sound that it could
be readily excavated without the support of the diaphragm,
and normally three miners worked in front
of the shield, digging out the clay and passing it
back through a doorway in the plate. This could be
closed in case of a sudden settlement or break in.
Following excavation, the shield was advanced 18
inches into the excavated area by means of 6 screws,
and a ring of lining segments 18 inches in length
bolted to the previous ring under cover of the overlapping
rear skirt of the shield. The small annular
space left between the outside of the lining and the
clay by the thickness and clearance of the skirt&mdash;about
an inch&mdash;was filled with thin cement grout. The
tunnel was advanced 18 inches during each 8-hour
shift. The work continued around the clock, and the
900-foot river section was completed in only 14 weeks.
<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
The entire work was completed almost without
incident in just under a year, a remarkable performance
for the world&rsquo;s second subaqueous tunnel.</p>

<p>The Tower Subway at first operated with cylindrical
cars that nearly filled the 7-foot bore; the cars
were drawn by cables powered by small steam
engines in the shafts. This mode of power had previously
been used in passenger service only on the
Greenwich Street elevated railway in New York.
Later the cars were abandoned as unprofitable and
the tunnel turned into a footway (<a href="#Fig_41_32">fig. 32</a>). This small
tunnel, the successful driving due entirely to Greathead&rsquo;s
skill, was the forerunner of the modern subaqueous
tunnel. In it, two of the three elements
essential to such work thereafter were first applied:
the one-piece movable shield of circular section, and
the segmental cast-iron lining.</p>

<p>The documentation of this work is far thinner than
for the Thames Tunnel. The most accurate source of
technical information is a brief historical account in
Copperthwaite&rsquo;s classic <i>Tunnel Shields and the Use of
Compressed Air in Subaqueous Works</i>, published in 1906.
Copperthwaite, a successful tunnel engineer, laments
the fact that he was able to turn up no drawing or
original data on this first shield of Greathead&rsquo;s, but
he presents a sketch of it prepared in the Greathead
office in 1895, which is presumably a fair representation
(<a href="#Fig_41_33">fig. 33</a>). The Tower Subway model was built
on the basis of this and several woodcuts of the working
area that appeared contemporaneously in the
illustrated press. In this and the adjacent model of
Beach&rsquo;s Broadway Subway, the tunnel axis has been
placed on an angle to the viewer, projecting the bore
into the case so that the complete circle of the working
face is included for a more suggestive effect. This
was possible because of the short length of the work
included.</p>

<p>Henry S. Drinker, also a tunnel engineer and author
of the most comprehensive work on tunneling ever
published, treats rock tunneling in exhaustive detail
up to 1878. His notice of what he terms &ldquo;submarine
tunneling&rdquo; is extremely brief. He does, however,
draw a most interesting comparison between the first
Thames Tunnel, built by Brunel, and the second,
built by Greathead 26 years later:</p>

<p class="caption3">BEACH&rsquo;S BROADWAY SUBWAY</p>

<p>Almost simultaneously with the construction of the
Tower Subway, the first American shield tunnel was
driven by Alfred Ely Beach (1826-1896). Beach, as
editor of the <i>Scientific American</i> and inventor of, among
other things, a successful typewriter as early as 1856,
was well known and respected in technical circles.
He was not a civil engineer, but had become concerned
with New York&rsquo;s pressing traffic problem
(even then) and as a solution, developed plans for a
rapid-transit subway to extend the length of Broadway.
He invented a shield as an adjunct to this system,
solely to permit driving of the tunnel without disturbing
the overlying streets.</p>

<p>An active patent attorney as well, Beach must
certainly have known of and studied the existing
patents for tunneling shields, which were, without
exception, British. In certain aspects his shield
resembled the one patented by Barlow in 1864, but
never built. However, work on the Beach tunnel
started in 1869, so close in time to that on the Tower
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Subway, that it is unlikely that there was any influence
from that source. Beach had himself patented
a shield, in June 1869, a two-piece, sectional design
that bore no resemblance to the one used. His
subway plan had been first introduced at the 1867
fair of the American Institute in the form of a short
plywood tube through which a small, close-fitting
car was blown by a fan. The car carried 12 passengers.
Sensing opposition to the subway scheme
from Tammany, in 1868 Beach obtained a charter
to place a small tube beneath Broadway for transporting
mail and small packages pneumatically, a
plan he advocated independently of the passenger
subway.</p>

<p>Under this thin pretense of legal authorization, the
sub-rosa excavation began from the basement of a
clothing store on Warren Street near Broadway. The
8-foot-diameter tunnel ran eastward a short distance,
made a 90-degree turn, and thence southward under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
Broadway to stop a block away under the south side
of Murray Street. The total distance was about 312
feet. Work was carried on at night in total secrecy,
the actual tunneling taking 58 nights. At the Warren
Street terminal, a waiting room was excavated and a
large Roots blower installed for propulsion of the single
passenger car. The plan was similar to that used
with the model in 1867: the cylindrical car fitted the
circular tunnel with only slight circumferential clearance.
The blower created a plenum within the waiting
room and tunnel area behind the car of about
0.25 pounds per square inch, resulting in a thrust on
the car of almost a ton, not accounting for blowby.
The car was thus blown along its course, and was
returned by reversing the blower&rsquo;s suction and discharge
ducts to produce an equivalent vacuum within
the tunnel.</p>

<p>The system opened in February of 1870 and remained
in operation for about a year. Beach was
ultimately subdued by the hostile influences of Boss
Tweed, and the project was completely abandoned.
Within a very few more years the first commercially
operated elevated line was built, but the subway did
not achieve legitimate status in New York until the
opening of the Interborough line in 1904. Ironically,
its route traversed Broadway for almost the length of
the island.</p>

<p>The Beach shield operated with perfect success in
this brief trial, although the loose sandy soil encountered
was admittedly not a severe test of its qualities.
No diaphragm was used; instead a series of 8 horizontal
shelves with sharpened leading edges extended
across the front opening of the shield. The outstanding
feature of the machine was the substitution
for the propelling screws used by Brunel and
Greathead of 18 hydraulic rams, set around its
circumference. These were fed by a single hand-operated
pump, seen in the center of figure 34. By
this means the course of the shield&rsquo;s forward movement
could be controlled with a convenience and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
precision not attainable with screws. Vertical and
horizontal deflection was achieved by throttling the
supply of water to certain of the rams, which could
be individually controlled, causing greater pressure
on one portion of the shield than another. This
system has not changed in the ensuing time, except,
of course, in the substitution of mechanically produced
hydraulic pressure for hand.</p>

<p>Unlike the driving of the Tower Subway, no excavation
was done in front of the shield. Rather,
the shield was forced by the rams into the soil for
the length of their stroke, the material which entered
being supported by the shelves. This was removed
from the shelves and hauled off. The ram plungers
then were withdrawn and a 16-inch length of the
permanent lining built up within the shelter of the
shield&rsquo;s tail ring. Against this, the rams bore for the
next advance. Masonry lining was used in the
straight section; cast-iron in the curved. The juncture
is shown in the model.</p>

<p>Enlarged versions of the Beach shield were used in a
few tunnels in the Midwest in the early 1870&rsquo;s, but
from then until 1886 the shield method, for no clear
reason, again entered a period of disuse finding no
application on either side of the Atlantic despite its
virtually unqualified proof at the hands of Greathead
and Beach. Little precise information remains on
this work. The Beach system of pneumatic transit is
described fully in a well-illustrated booklet published
by him in January 1868, in which the American Institute
model is shown, and many projected systems
of pneumatic propulsion as well as of subterranean
and subaqueous tunneling described. Beach again
(presumably) is author of the sole contemporary account
of the Broadway Subway, which appeared in
<i>Scientific American</i> following its opening early in 1870.
Included are good views of the tunnel and car, of the
shield in operation, and, most important, a vertical
sectional view through the shield (<a href="#Fig_41_35">fig. 35</a>).</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that optical surveys for
maintenance of the course apparently were not used.
The article illustrated and described the driving each
night of a jointed iron rod up through the tunnel
roof to the street, twenty or so feet above, for &ldquo;testing
the position.&rdquo;</p>


<p class="caption3" style="clear:both;">THE FIRST HUDSON RIVER TUNNEL</p>

<p>Despite the ultimate success of Brunel&rsquo;s Thames
Tunnel in 1843, the shield in that case afforded only
moderately reliable protection because of the fluidity
of the soil driven through, and its tendency to enter
the works through the smallest opening in the shield&rsquo;s
defense. An English doctor who had made physiological
studies of the effects on workmen of the high
air pressure within diving bells is said to have recommended
to Brunel in 1828 that he introduce an
atmosphere of compressed air into the tunnel to exclude
the water and support the work face.</p>

<p>This plan was first formally described by Sir Thomas
Cochrane (1775-1860) in a British patent of 1830.
Conscious of Brunel&rsquo;s problems, he proposed a system
of shaft sinking, mining, and tunneling in water-bearing
materials by filling the excavated area with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
air sufficiently above atmospheric pressure to prevent
the water from entering and to support the earth. In
this, and his description of air locks for passage of men
and materials between the atmosphere and the pressurized
area, Cochrane fully outlined the essential
features of pneumatic excavation as developed since.</p>

<p style="clear:both;">In 1839, a French engineer first used the system in
sinking a mine shaft through a watery stratum. From
then on, the sinking of shafts, and somewhat later the
construction of bridge pier foundations, by the pneumatic
method became almost commonplace engineering
practice in Europe and America. Not until 1879
however, was the system tried in tunneling work, and
then, as with the shield ten years earlier, almost
simultaneously here and abroad. The first application
was in a small river tunnel in Antwerp, only
5 feet in height. This project was successfully completed
relying on compressed air alone to support the
earth, no shield being used. The importance of the
work cannot be considered great due to its lack of
scope.</p>

<p>In 1871 Dewitt C. Haskin (1822-1900), a west
coast mine and railroad builder, became interested
in the pneumatic caissons then being used to found
the river piers of Eads&rsquo; Mississippi River bridge at
St. Louis. In apparent total ignorance of the Cochrane
patent, he evolved a similar system for tunneling
water-bearing media, and in 1873 proposed construction
of a tunnel through the silt beneath the Hudson
to provide rail connection between New Jersey and
New York City.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to imagine a site more in need
of such communication. All lines from the south
terminated along the west shore of the river and the
immense traffic&mdash;cars, freight and passengers&mdash;was
carried across to Manhattan Island by ferry and
barge with staggering inconvenience and at enormous
cost. A bridge would have been, and still is, almost
out of the question due not only to the width of the
crossing, but to the flatness of both banks. To provide
sufficient navigational clearance (without a drawspan),
impracticably long approaches would have
been necessary to obtain a permissibly gentle grade.</p>

<p><a name="Haskin" id="Haskin"></a>
Haskin formed a tunneling company and began
work with the sinking of a shaft in Hoboken on the
New Jersey side. In a month it was halted because
of an injunction by, curiously, the D L &amp; W Railroad,
who feared for their vast investment in terminal and
marine facilities. Not until November of 1879 was
the injunction lifted and work again commenced.
The shaft was completed and an air lock located in
one wall from which the tunnel proper was to be
carried forward. It was Haskin&rsquo;s plan to use no
shield, relying solely on the pressure of compressed
air to maintain the work faces and prevent the entry
of water. The air was admitted in late December,
and the first large-scale pneumatic tunneling operation
launched. A single 26-foot, double-track bore
was at first undertaken, but a work face of such
diameter proved unmanageable and two oval tubes
18 feet high by 16 feet wide were substituted, each
to carry a single track. Work went forward with
reasonable facility, considering the lack of precedent.
A temporary entrance was formed of sheet-iron rings
from the air lock down to the tunnel grade, at which
point the permanent work of the north tube was
started. Immediately behind the excavation at the
face, a lining of thin wrought-iron plates was built up,
to provide form for the 2-foot, permanent brick lining
that followed. The three stages are shown in the
model in about their proper relationship of progress.
The work is shown passing beneath an old timber-crib
bulkhead, used for stabilizing the shoreline.</p>

<p>The silt of the riverbed was about the consistency of
putty and under good conditions formed a secure
barrier between the excavation and the river above.
It was easily excavated, and for removal was mixed
with water and blown out through a pipe into the
shaft by the higher pressure in the tunnel. About
half was left in the bore for removal later. The basic
scheme was workable, but in operation an extreme
precision was required in regulating the air pressure
in the work area.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a>
<a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> It was soon found that there
existed an 11-psi difference between the pressure of
water on the top and the bottom of the working face,
due to the 22-foot height of the unlined opening.
Thus, it was impossible to maintain perfect pneumatic
balance of the external pressure over the entire face.
It was necessary to strike an average with the result
that some water entered at the bottom of the face
where the water pressure was greatest, and some air
leaked out at the top where the water pressure was
below the air pressure. Constant attention was essential:
several men did nothing but watch the behavior
of the leaks and adjusted the pressure as the
ground density changed with advance. Air was supplied
by several steam-driven compressors at the
surface.</p>

<p>The air lock permitted passage back and forth of men
and supplies between the atmosphere and the work
area, without disturbing the pressure differential.
This principle is demonstrated by an animated model
set into the main model, to the left of the shaft
(<a href="#Fig_41_39">fig. 39</a>). The variation of
pressure within the lock chamber
to match the atmosphere or the pressurized area,
depending on the direction of passage, is clearly
shown by simplified valves and gauges, and by the
use of light in varying color density. In the Haskin
tunnel, 5 to 10 minutes were taken to pass the miners
through the lock so as to avoid too abrupt a physiological
change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>
<p>Despite caution, a blowout occurred in July 1880
due to air leakage not at the face, but around the
temporary entrance. One door of the air lock jammed
and twenty men drowned, resulting in an inquiry
which brought forth much of the distrust with which
Haskin was regarded by the engineering profession.
His ability and qualifications were subjected to the
bitterest attack in and by the technical press. There
is some indication that, although the project began
with a staff of competent engineers, they were
alienated by Haskin in the course of work and at least
one withdrew. Haskin&rsquo;s remarks in his own defense
indicate that some of the denunciation was undoubtedly
justified. And yet, despite this reaction, the
fundamental merit of the pneumatic tunneling method
had been demonstrated by Haskin and was immediately
recognized and freely acknowledged. It was
apparent at the same time, however, that air by itself
did not provide a sufficiently reliable support for
large-area tunnel works in unstable ground, and this
remains the only major subaqueous tunnel work
driven with air alone.</p>

<p>After the accident, work continued under Haskin
until 1882 when funds ran out. About 1600 feet of
the north tube and 600 feet of the south tube had been
completed. Greathead resumed operations with a
shield for a British company in 1889, but exhaustion
of funds again caused stoppage in 1891. The tunnel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
was finally completed in 1904, and is now in use as part
of the Hudson and Manhattan rapid-transit system,
never providing the sought-after rail link. A splendid
document of the Haskin portion of the work is S. D. V.
Burr&rsquo;s <i>Tunneling Under the Hudson River</i> published in
1885. It is based entirely upon firsthand material and
contains drawings of most of the work, including the
auxiliary apparatus. It is interesting to note that
electric illumination (arc, not incandescent, lights) and
telephones were used, unquestionably the first employment
of either in tunnel work.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE ST. CLAIR TUNNEL</p>

<p>The final model of the soft-ground series reflects, as
did the Hoosac Tunnel model for hard-rock tunneling,
final emergence into the modern period. Although
the St. Clair Tunnel was completed over 70 years ago,
it typifies in its method of construction, the basic
procedures of subaqueous work in the present day.
The Thames Tunnel of Brunel, and Haskin&rsquo;s efforts
beneath the Hudson, had clearly shown that by
themselves, both the shield and pneumatic systems of
driving through fluid ground were defective in practice
for tunnels of large area. Note that the earliest
successful works by each method had been of very
small area, so that the influence of adverse conditions
was greatly diminished.</p>

<p>The first man to perceive and seize upon the benefits
to be gained by combining the two systems was,
most fittingly, Greathead. Although he had projected
the technique earlier, in driving the underground City
and South London Railway in 1886, he brought
together for the first time the three fundamental elements
essential for the practical tunneling of soft,
water-bearing ground: compressed-air support of the
work during construction, the movable shield, and cast-iron,
permanent lining. The marriage was a happy
one indeed; the limitations of each system were almost
perfectly overcome by the qualities of the others.</p>

<p>The conditions prevailing in 1882 at the Sarnia,
Ontario, terminal of the Grand Trunk Railway, both
operational and physical, were almost precisely the
same as those which inspired the undertaking of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
Hudson River Tunnel. The heavy traffic at this
vital U.S.&mdash;Canada rail interchange was ferried inconveniently
across the wide St. Clair River, and the
bank and river conditions precluded construction of a
bridge. A tunnel was projected by the railway in
that year, the time when Haskin&rsquo;s tribulations were
at their height. Perhaps because of this lack of precedent
for a work of such size, nothing was done
immediately. In 1884 the railway organized a tunnel
company; in 1886 test borings were made in the riverbed
and small exploratory drifts were started across
from both banks by normal methods of mine timbering.
The natural gas, quicksand, and water
encountered soon stopped the work.</p>

</div>

<p>It was at this time that the railway&rsquo;s president
visited Greathead&rsquo;s City and South London workings.
The obvious answer to the St. Clair problem lay in
the successful conduct of this subway. Joseph
Hobson, chief engineer of the Grand Trunk and of
the tunnel project, in designing a shield, is said to
have searched for drawings of the shields used in
the Broadway and Tower Subways of 1868-9, but
unable to locate any, he relied to a limited extent
on the small drawings of those in Drinker&rsquo;s volume.
There is no explanation as to why he did not have
drawings of the City and South London shield at that
moment in use, unless one considers the rather unlikely
possibility that Greathead maintained its
design in secrecy.</p>

<p>The Hobson shield followed Greathead&rsquo;s as closely
as any other, in having a diaphragm with closable
doors, but a modification of Beach&rsquo;s sharpened
horizontal shelves was also used. However, these
functioned more as working platforms than supports
for the earth. The machine was 21&frac12; feet in diameter,
an unprecedented size and almost twice that of
Greathead&rsquo;s current one. It was driven by 24
hydraulic rams. Throughout the entire preliminary
consideration of the project there was a marked sense
of caution that amounted to what seems an almost
total lack of confidence in success. Commencement
of the work from vertical shafts was planned so that
if the tunnel itself failed, no expenditure would have
been made for approach work. In April 1888, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
shafts were started near both riverbanks, but before
reaching proper depth the almost fluid clay and silt
flowed up faster than it could be excavated and this
plan was abandoned. After this second inauspicious
start, long open approach cuts were made and the
work finally began. The portals were established in
the cuts, several thousand feet back from each bank
and there the tunneling itself began. The portions
under the shore were driven without air. When the
banks were reached, brick bulkheads containing air
locks were built across the opening and the section
beneath the river, about 3,710 feet long, driven under
air pressure of 10 to 28 pounds above atmosphere.
For most of the way, the clay was firm and there was
little air leakage. It was found that horses could not
survive in the compressed air, and so mules were
used under the river.</p>

<p>In the firm clay, excavation was carried on several
feet in front of the shield, as shown in the model
(<a href="#Fig_41_42">fig. 42</a>). About twelve
miners worked at the face. However,
in certain strata the clay encountered was so
fluid that the shield could be simply driven forward by
the rams, causing the muck to flow in at the door
openings without excavation. After each advance,
the rams were retracted and a ring of iron lining
segments built up, as in the Tower Subway. Here,
for the first time, an &ldquo;erector arm&rdquo; was used for
placing the segments, which weighed about half a ton.
In all respects, the work advanced with wonderful
facility and lack of operational difficulty. Considering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
the large area, no subaqueous tunnel had ever
been driven with such speed. The average monthly
progress for the American and Canadian headings
totaled 455 feet, and at top efficiency 10 rings or a
length of 15.3 feet could be set in a 24-hour day in
each heading. The 6,000 feet of tunnel was driven in
just a year; the two shields met vis-a-vis in August of
1890.</p>

<p>The transition was complete. The work had been
closely followed by the technical journals and the
reports of its successful accomplishment thus were
brought to the attention of the entire civil engineering
profession. As the first major subaqueous tunnel
completed in America and the first in the world of
a size able to accommodate full-scale rail traffic, the
St. Clair Tunnel served to dispel the doubts surrounding
such work, and established the pattern for a mode
of tunneling which has since changed only in matters
of detail.</p>

<p>Of the eight models, only this one was built under
the positive guidance of original documents. In the
possession of the Canadian National Railways are
drawings not only of all elements of the shield and
lining, but of much of the auxiliary apparatus used
in construction. Such materials rarely survive, and
do so in this case only because of the foresight of the
railway which, to avoid paying a high profit margin
to a private contractor as compensation for the risk
and uncertainty involved, carried the contract itself
and, therefore, preserved all original drawing records.</p>

<p>While the engineering of tunnels has been comprehensively
treated in this paper from the historical
standpoint, it is well to still reflect that the advances
made in tunneling have not perceptibly removed the
elements of uncertainty but have only provided more
positive and effective means of countering their
forces. Still to be faced are the surprises of hidden
streams, geologic faults, shifts of strata, unstable materials,
and areas of extreme pressure and temperature.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> There are two important secondary techniques for opening
subterranean and subaqueous ways, neither a method truly of
tunneling. One of these, of ancient origin, used mainly in the
construction of shallow subways and utility ways, is the &ldquo;cut
and cover&rdquo; system, whereby an open trench is excavated and
then roofed over. The result is, in effect, a tunnel. The concept
of the other method was propounded in the early 19th
century but only used practically in recent years. This is the
&ldquo;trench&rdquo; method, a sort of subaqueous equivalent of cut and
cover. A trench is dredged in the bed of a body of water,
into which prefabricated sections of large diameter tube are
lowered, in a continuous line. The joints are then sealed by
divers, the trench is backfilled over the tube, the ends are
brought up to dryland portals, the water is pumped out, and a
subterranean passage results. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge
Tunnel (1960-1964) is a recent major work of this character.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> In 1952 a successful machine was developed on this plan,
with hardened rollers on a revolving cutting head for disintegrating
the rock. The idea is basically sound, possessing advantages
in certain situations over conventional drilling and
blasting systems.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> In 1807 the noted Cornish engineer Trevithick commenced
a small timbered drift beneath the Thames, 5 feet by 3 feet, as
an exploratory passage for a larger vehicular tunnel. Due to
the small frontal area, he was able to successfully probe about
1000 feet, but the river then broke in and halted the work.
Mine tunnels had also reached beneath the Irish Sea and various
rivers in the coal regions of Newcastle, but these were so far
below the surface as to be in perfectly solid ground and can
hardly be considered subaqueous workings.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> Unlike the Brunel tunnel, this was driven from both ends
simultaneously, the total overall progress thus being 3 feet per
shift rather than 18 inches. A top speed of 9 feet per day could
be advanced by each shield under ideal conditions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Ideally, the pressure of air within the work area of a
pneumatically driven tunnel should just balance the hydrostatic head of
the water without, which is a function of its total height above the
opening. If the air pressure is not high enough, water will, of course,
enter, and if very low, there is danger of complete collapse of the
unsupported ground areas. If too high, the air pressure will overcome
that due to the water and the air will force its way out through the
ground, through increasingly larger openings, until it all rushes out
suddenly in a &ldquo;blowout.&rdquo; The pressurized atmosphere gone, the water then
is able to pour in through the same opening, flooding the workings.</p></div>

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
